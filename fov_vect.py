def get_intersections(across, along, cam, rot_mat):
    '''
    Finds the intersection of rays from the camera with the earth.  
    
    Given the off nadir angles of rays and camera parameters, uses the quadratic formula to find the intersection of the rays with an ellipsoid modelling the Earth.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    across : ndarray
        N by 4*M array containing the components of the off nadir angle (radians) in the across track direction. Each element represents a different vertex. Rows are snapshots in time; each is associated with a different camera position and orientation.
    along : ndarray
        N by 4*M array containing the components of the off nadir angle (radians) in the along track direction. Each element represents a different vertex. Rows are snapshots in time; each is associated with a different camera position and orientation.
    cam : ndarray
        3 by N array containing ECEF coordinates (meters) of the camera. 
    rot_mat : ndarray
        3 by 3 by N array containing the orientation of the camera with respect to the ECEF frame in the form of normalized rotation matrices. By convention, the second column is the vector in the direction of the instantaneous velocity, the third column is the vector along the optical axis pointing towards the scanline, and the first column is the cross product of the second and third columns.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        3 by N by 4*M array of the vertices of each scanline/pixel in ECEF coordinates (meters).
    
    Notes
    -----
    `rot_mat` and `cam` are extended in `get_area` so that entries exist for each vertex and not just for each scanline/pixel.
    Uses WGS84 for ellipsoid model and ECEF coordinates.
